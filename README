This is a short sudoku solver I made as a side project. It scrapes the Nytimes Sudoku puzzle and then completes it, also allowing an autofill to fill in the puzzle on the webpage. It uses selenium to scrape the board and then uses a backtracking algorithm to solve it. It's not the most time efficient algorithm and could be made better. Has an issue with boards that are mainly empty and have a lot of spots that could be 2 or 3 numbers.
